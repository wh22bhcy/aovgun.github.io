Ali Ã–vgÃ¼n is an Associate Professor of Physics at Eastern Mediterranean University in GazimaÄŸusa, Cyprus. His research is at some of the interfaces between quantum gravity, cosmology, particle physics and astrophysics. He is particularly interested in the quantum gravity and its implications for black hole physics and cosmology beyond their standard models.

His research is focused on understanding and constraining modified gravity theories using various properties of black holes and cosmological evolution. He has contributed to various analysis methods, which are now amongst the most widely used ones for calculating the Hawking radiation, gravitational lensing, and shadow cast of black holes. He has been studying various aspects of general relativity in relation to black hole properties, wormholes, compact stars, Hawking radiation, and cosmological inflation. These implications often follow from the structure of extra-dimensional geometries, of which there are many possibilities. Ã–vgÃ¼nâ€™s research therefore requires importing techniques from mathematics and computer science. He is among Worldâ€™s Top 2% Scientists in the Stanford University 2020 & 2021 Releases Lists.
