# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research is focused on understanding and constraining modified gravity theories using various properties of black holes and cosmological evolution. I have contributed to various analysis methods, which are now amongst the most widely used ones for calculating the Hawking radiation, gravitational lensing, and shadow cast of black holes. I have been studying various aspects of general relativity in relation to black hole properties, wormholes, compact stars, Hawking radiation, and cosmological inflation. I am among Worldâ€™s Top 2% Scientists in the Stanford University 2020 & 2021 Releases Lists.
